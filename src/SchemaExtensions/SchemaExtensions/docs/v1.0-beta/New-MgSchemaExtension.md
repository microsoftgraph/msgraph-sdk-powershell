# New-MgSchemaExtension

## SYNOPSIS
Create a new schemaExtension definition and its associated schema extension property to extend a supporting resource type.
Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource.
The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app.
Depending on the \nstate of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension.
See examples of how to define a schema extension that describes a training course, \nuse the schema extension definition to create a new group with training course data, and \nadd training course data to an existing group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Using the New-MgSchemaExtension Cmdlet
```powershell
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.SchemaExtensions
$params = @{
	Id = "graphlearn_courses"
	Description = "Graph Learn training courses extensions"
	TargetTypes = @(
		"Group"
	)
	Properties = @(
		@{
			Name = "courseId"
			Type = "Integer"
		}
		@{
			Name = "courseName"
			Type = "String"
		}
		@{
			Name = "courseType"
			Type = "String"
		}
	)
}
New-MgSchemaExtension -BodyParameter $params
```

This example shows how to use the New-MgSchemaExtension Cmdlet.

## PARAMETERS

### -AdditionalProperties
Additional Parameters

```yaml
Type: System.Collections.Hashtable
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BodyParameter
schemaExtension
To construct, please use Get-Help -Online and see NOTES section for BODYPARAMETER properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphSchemaExtension
Parameter Sets: Create
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Description for the schema extension.
Supports $filter (eq).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner
The appId of the application that is the owner of the schema extension.
This property can be supplied on creation, to set the owner.
If not supplied, then the calling application's appId will be set as the owner.
In either case, the signed-in user must be the owner of the application.
So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you must supply the owner property.
Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
Supports $filter (eq).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Properties
The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.
To construct, please use Get-Help -Online and see NOTES section for PROPERTIES properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphExtensionSchemaProperty[]
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Status
The lifecycle state of the schema extension.
Possible states are InDevelopment, Available, and Deprecated.
Automatically set to InDevelopment on creation.
For more information about the possible state transitions and behaviors, see Schema extensions lifecycle.
Supports $filter (eq).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TargetTypes
Set of Microsoft Graph types (that can support extensions) that the schema extension can be applied to.
Select from administrativeUnit, contact, device, event, group, message, organization, post, todoTask, todoTaskList, or user.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
