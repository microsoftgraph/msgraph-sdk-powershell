# New-MgBetaSchemaExtension

## SYNOPSIS
Create a new schemaExtension definition and its associated schema extension property to extend a supporting resource type.
Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource.
The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app.
Depending on the \nstate of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension.
See examples of how to define a schema extension that describes a training course, \nuse the schema extension definition to create a new group with training course data, and \nadd training course data to an existing group.
This API is available in the following national cloud deployments.

## PARAMETERS

### -AdditionalProperties
Additional Parameters

```yaml
Type: System.Collections.Hashtable
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BodyParameter
schemaExtension
To construct, see NOTES section for BODYPARAMETER properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.Beta.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphSchemaExtension
Parameter Sets: Create
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Description for the schema extension.
Supports $filter (eq).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
The unique identifier for an entity.
Read-only.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner
The appId of the application that is the owner of the schema extension.
The owner of the schema definition must be explicitly specified during the Create and Update operations, or it will be implied and auto-assigned by Azure AD as follows: In delegated access: The signed-in user must be the owner of the app that calls Microsoft Graph to create the schema extension definition.
If the signed-in user isn't the owner of the calling app, they must explicitly specify the owner property, and assign it the appId of an app that they own.
In app-only access: The owner property isn't required in the request body.
Instead, the calling app is assigned ownership of the schema extension.
So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you must supply the owner property.
Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.
Supports $filter (eq).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Properties
The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.
To construct, see NOTES section for PROPERTIES properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.Beta.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphExtensionSchemaProperty[]
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Status
The lifecycle state of the schema extension.
Possible states are InDevelopment, Available, and Deprecated.
Automatically set to InDevelopment on creation.
For more information about the possible state transitions and behaviors, see Schema extensions lifecycle.
Supports $filter (eq).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TargetTypes
Set of Microsoft Graph types (that can support extensions) that the schema extension can be applied to.
Select from administrativeUnit, contact, device, event, group, message, organization, post, todoTask, todoTaskList, or user.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
