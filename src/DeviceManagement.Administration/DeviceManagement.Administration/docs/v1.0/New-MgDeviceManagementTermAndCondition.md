```

### -AcceptanceStatuses
The list of acceptance statuses for this T&C policy.
To construct, please use Get-Help -Online and see NOTES section for ACCEPTANCESTATUSES properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphTermsAndConditionsAcceptanceStatus1[]
