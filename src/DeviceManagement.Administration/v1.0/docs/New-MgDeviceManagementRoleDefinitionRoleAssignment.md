## PARAMETERS

### -AdditionalProperties
Additional Parameters

```yaml
Type: System.Collections.Hashtable
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BodyParameter
The Role Assignment resource.
Role assignments tie together a role definition with members and scopes.
There can be one or more role assignments per role.
This applies to custom and built-in roles.
To construct, see NOTES section for BODYPARAMETER properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphRoleAssignment
Parameter Sets: Create, CreateViaIdentity
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description
Description of the Role Assignment.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayName
The display or friendly name of the role Assignment.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
The unique idenfier for an entity.
Read-only.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Identity Parameter
To construct, see NOTES section for INPUTOBJECT properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.IDeviceManagementAdministrationIdentity
Parameter Sets: CreateViaIdentity, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ResourceScopes
List of ids of role scope member security groups.
These are IDs from Azure Active Directory.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RoleDefinition
The Role Definition resource.
The role definition is the foundation of role based access in Intune.
The role combines an Intune resource such as a Mobile App and associated role permissions such as Create or Read for the resource.
There are two types of roles, built-in and custom.
Built-in roles cannot be modified.
Both built-in roles and custom roles must have assignments to be enforced.
Create custom roles if you want to define a role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be combined into a single role.
To construct, see NOTES section for ROLEDEFINITION properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.IMicrosoftGraphRoleDefinition
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded, CreateViaIdentityExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RoleDefinitionId
The unique identifier of roleDefinition

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: Create, CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
