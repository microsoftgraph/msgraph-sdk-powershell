Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False

COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


APPSCOPE <IMicrosoftGraphAppScope>: appScope
  - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
  - `[Id <String>]`: Read-only.
  - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Provides the display name of the app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes since appScopeId is often an immutable, non-human-readable id. Read-only.
  - `[Type <String>]`: Describes the type of app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes, so a user interface can convey to the user the kind of app specific resource represented by the app scope. Read-only.
