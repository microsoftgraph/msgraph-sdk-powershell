COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphAdministrativeUnit>: administrativeUnit
  - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
  - `[DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: Date and time when this object was deleted. Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.
  - `[Id <String>]`:
