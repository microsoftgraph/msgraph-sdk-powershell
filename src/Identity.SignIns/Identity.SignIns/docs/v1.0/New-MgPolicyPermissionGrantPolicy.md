COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphPermissionGrantPolicy1>: Represents an Azure Active Directory object. The directoryObject type is the base type for many other directory entity types.
