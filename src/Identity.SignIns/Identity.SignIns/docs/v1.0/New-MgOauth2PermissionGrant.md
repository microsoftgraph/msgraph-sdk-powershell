## DESCRIPTION
Create a delegated permission grant represented by an oAuth2PermissionGrant object.
A delegated permission grant authorizes a client service principal (representing a client application) to access a resource service principal (representing an API), on behalf of a signed-in user, for the level of access limited by the delegated permissions which were granted.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Using the New-MgOauth2PermissionGrant Cmdlet
```powershell
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns
$params = @{
	ClientId = "ef969797-201d-4f6b-960c-e9ed5f31dab5"
	ConsentType = "AllPrincipals"
	ResourceId = "943603e4-e787-4fe9-93d1-e30f749aae39"
	Scope = "DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All"
}
New-MgOauth2PermissionGrant -BodyParameter $params
```

This example shows how to use the New-MgOauth2PermissionGrant Cmdlet.
