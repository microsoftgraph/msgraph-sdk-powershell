COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.


`ALERTRECORDS <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementAlertRecord[]>`: The collection of records of alert events.
  - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
  - `[AlertImpact <IMicrosoftGraphDeviceManagementAlertImpact>]`: alertImpact
    - `[(Any) <Object>]`: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    - `[AggregationType <String>]`: aggregationType
    - `[AlertImpactDetails <IMicrosoftGraphKeyValuePair[]>]`: The detail information of the impact. For example, if the Frontline Cloud PCs near concurrency limit alert is triggered, the details contain the impacted Frontline license SKU name, such as Windows 365 Frontline 2 vCPU/8GB/128GB, and the corresponding impacted value.
      - `[Name <String>]`: Name for this key-value pair
      - `[Value <String>]`: Value for this key-value pair
    - `[Value <Int32?>]`: The number value of the impact. For the aggregation types of count and affectedCloudPcCount, the value indicates the number of affected instances. For example, 6 affectedCloudPcCount means that 6 Cloud PCs are affected. For the aggregation types of percentage and affectedCloudPcPercentage, the value indicates the percent of affected instances. For example, 12 affectedCloudPcPercentage means that 12% of Cloud PCs are affected.
  - `[AlertRuleId <String>]`: The corresponding ID of the alert rule.
  - `[AlertRuleTemplate <String>]`: alertRuleTemplate
  - `[DetectedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time when the alert event was detected. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z.
  - `[DisplayName <String>]`: The display name of the alert record.
  - `[LastUpdatedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time when the alert record was last updated. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z.
  - `[ResolvedDateTime <DateTime?>]`: The date and time when the alert event was resolved. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z.
