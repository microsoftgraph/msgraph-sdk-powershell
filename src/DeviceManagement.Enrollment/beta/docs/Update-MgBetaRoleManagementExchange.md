COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

    - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Provides the display name of the app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes since appScopeId is often an immutable, non-human-readable id. This property is read only.
    - `[Type <String>]`: Describes the type of app-specific resource represented by the app scope and is provided for display purposes, so a user interface can convey to the user the kind of app specific resource represented by the app scope. This property is read only.

    - `[Name <String>]`: Name of the resource namespace. Typically, the same name as the id property, such as microsoft.aad.b2c. Required. Supports $filter (eq, startsWith).
    - `[ResourceActions <IMicrosoftGraphUnifiedRbacResourceAction[]>]`: Operations that an authorized principal is allowed to perform.
      - `[Id <String>]`: The unique identifier for an entity. Read-only.
      - `[ActionVerb <String>]`: HTTP method for the action, such as DELETE, GET, PATCH, POST, PUT, or null. Supports $filter (eq) but not for null values.

        - `[DisplayName <String>]`: A friendly name that identifies the authenticationContextClassReference object when building user-facing admin experiences. For example, a selection UX.
        - `[IsAvailable <Boolean?>]`: Indicates whether the authenticationContextClassReference has been published by the security admin and is ready for use by apps. When it's set to false, it shouldn't be shown in selection UX used to tag resources with authentication context class values.

      - `[IsPrivileged <Boolean?>]`: Flag indicating if the role is privileged. Microsoft Entra ID defines a role as privileged if it contains at least one sensitive resource action in the rolePermissions and allowedResourceActions objects. Applies only for actions in the microsoft.directory resource namespace. Read-only. Supports $filter (eq).
      - `[ResourceScopes <String[]>]`: List of scopes permissions granted by the role definition apply to. Currently only / is supported. Read-only when isBuiltIn is true. DO NOT USE. This will be deprecated soon. Attach scope to role assignment.
