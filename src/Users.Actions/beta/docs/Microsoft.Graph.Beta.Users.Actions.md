For developers, if the application attempts to redeem a delegated access token for this user by using an invalidated refresh token, the application will get an error.

Submits an email request on behalf of the signed-in user to unsubscribe from an email distribution list.

Message senders can use mailing lists in a user-friendly way by including an option for recipients to opt out.
They can do so by specifying the List-Unsubscribe header in each message following RFC-2369.
Note In particular, for the unsubscribe action to work, the sender must specify mailto: and not URL-based unsubscribe information.
Setting that header would also set the unsubscribeEnabled property of the message instance to true, and the unsubscribeData property to the header data.
If the unsubscribeEnabled property of a message is true, you can use the unsubscribe action to unsubscribe the user from similar future messages as managed by the message sender.
A successful unsubscribe action moves the message to the Deleted Items folder.
The actual exclusion of the user from future mail distribution is managed by the sender.

Create an upload session that allows an app to iteratively upload ranges of a file, so as to attach the file to an Outlook item.
The item can be a message or event.
Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB.
To attach a file that's smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event.
As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries.
Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded.
This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload.
