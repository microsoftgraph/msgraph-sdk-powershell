For subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.

With this new property in the subscription creation payload along with all existing properties, Webhooks will deliver notifications whenever a resource reaches the desired state mentioned in the notificationQueryOptions property. For example, when the print job is completed or when a print job resource isFetchable property value becomes true etc.
                        - `[NotificationUrl <String>]`: Required. The URL of the endpoint that receives the change notifications. This URL must make use of the HTTPS protocol.
                        - `[NotificationUrlAppId <String>]`: Optional. The app ID that the subscription service can use to generate the validation token. This allows the client to validate the authenticity of the notification received.
