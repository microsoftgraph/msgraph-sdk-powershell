## Key Features

- **Access Token Proof of Possession (AT PoP)**: This feature binds tokens to specific HTTP methods and URIs, preventing misuse of tokens by ensuring they are used only for the intended HTTP requests.
- **Updated Dependencies**: Compatibility improvements with recent library changes.
- **Enhanced Token Acquisition Options**: Users can now specify the HTTP method and URI during token acquisition to further secure token usage.

### Token acquisition behaviors

| Condition | Unbound (default) | Bound (PoP) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| First sign-in | New token, interactive| New token, interactive |
| Existing token, same URI | No new token, silent | No new token, silent |
| Existing token, different URI | No new token, silent | New token, silent |
| Existing expired token, below max token refreshes | New token, silent | New token, silent |
| Existing expired token, exceeded max refreshes | New token, interactive | New token, interactive |

## Installation

To install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK with the latest updates, use the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -AllowClobber -Force
```

Ensure you are using the latest version to access the AT PoP functionality.

## Configuration

### Enabling Access Token Proof of Possession

To enable AT PoP, configure the Microsoft Graph SDK options as follows:

```powershell
Set-MgGraphOption -EnableATPoP $true

Connect-MgGraph
```

This configuration ensures that the acquired token is only valid for the specified HTTP method and URI.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1:

```powershell
Set-MgGraphOption -EnableATPoP $true

Connect-MgGraph

Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me -Debug
```

### Example 2:

```powershell
Set-MgGraphOption -EnableATPoP $true

Connect-MgGraph

Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/sendMail" -Method POST -Debug
```
