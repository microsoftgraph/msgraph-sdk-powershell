      description: 'Get a collection of bookingBusiness objects that has been created for the tenant. This operation returns only the **id** and **displayName** of each Microsoft Bookings business in the collection. For performance considerations, it does not return other properties. You can get the other properties of a Bookings business by specifying its **id** in a GET operation. You can also query for Bookings businesses by specifying a string in a `query` parameter to do substring matching among the businesses of a tenant. See an example below.'
